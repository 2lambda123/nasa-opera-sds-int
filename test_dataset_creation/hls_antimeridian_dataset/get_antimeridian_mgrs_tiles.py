This script is really just a capture of my interactive iPython session.
I have never run this file as a script, but rather just copy+paste lines into iPython.
Turning this into a script wouldn't be hard, it just takes more time than I have to give this task at the moment.

There are hard-coded filepaths down below, so beware of those before running the code.
Most of the inputs are in the repository.  The KML file is too big for GitHub, and needs to be downloaded by the user (link in the inline comments below).

The first part of the file is parsing the KML file to get the bounding polygons for all Tiles near the antimeridian.
Any TileIDs starting with one of the elements in `name_prefixes`.
It then pulls out the bounding polygons for each of those tiles.
If a Tile has a single bounding polygon, it does NOT cross the antimeridian.
If a Tile has two bounding polygons, it DOES cross the antimeridian (this was true for the handful of tiles I inspected, and then took this as an assumption).
The script will identify all tiles that cross the antimeridian.  These are in the variable `bbox_doubles`.
There are 298 such Tiles in total (not all of these are over land, and thus not all apply to the HLS data.

There are also 2 input files taken from queries in Earthdata Search.  I queried for all HLS data (both L30 and S30) in the first half of 2022 that are (roughly) within 200km of the antimeridian (the bounding polygon for the query went up to +/-85 lat, and I calculated 200km away from the antimeridian at 5 degree lat intervals, and fed that into Earthdata Search as the bounding polygon).
Those files start with `8433462866-download`.
I read those files, pull out the unique TileIDs.  HLSL30 had 110 unique tileIDs, and HLSS30 had 108 unique tileIDs.  I take one of each unique tileIDs to make an HLS dataset that's "near the antimeridian".  This list can be found in the variables `hlsl30_unique_tileIDs` and `hlss30_unique_tileIDs`.  They were also written to text files and committed into the repository (filenames end with `_near_antimeridian_tileIDs.txt`).

I also take the HLS tiles near the antimeridian, and intersect it with the 298 tiles that ACTUALLY cross the antimeridian.  Those are in the variables `hlsl30_antimeridian_tileIDs` and `hlss30_antimeridian_tileIDs`.  These were also written to text files and committed into the repository (filenames end with `antimeridian_tileIDs.txt`, without 'near').
